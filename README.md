Public repository for the Assignment 4 for the course DA5401

Assignment is contained in the DA5401_Assignment4_DA25C006.ipynb file. All sections have been run. In case rerun is to be done, you can get the data from [Kaggle]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)). Keep it in the same folder as the notebook.

I have used _italics_ in the markdown wherever I have stated some observation or fact, to distinguish it from the rest of the markdown text.

Thank you :)
